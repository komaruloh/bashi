bashi is an attempt to create a bash “framework” for executing a bash script. It tries to use separate config file for each script, with each config file contains block and the ability to use “default” block.

TODO :  1. Improving the flow of the framework. The script is called via
            parameter/argument to the main script, instead of listed in
            main.config.
        2. Adding logging and the abilities to resume canceled script 
            scheduled for running due to external major factor (i.e. 
            power down).
        3. Adding the ftp script to transfer processed files to remote
            location.
        4. Adding the notification abilities (via email) for predefined
            events.
